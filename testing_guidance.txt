# Todo List Application - Testing Guidance

## Overview
This document provides guidance for testing the Todo List application, covering all its features and functionality. Follow these steps to ensure the application works as expected.

## Core Features to Test

### 1. Task Management
- **Adding Tasks**
  - Add a task with a short name (2-3 characters)
  - Add a task with a very long name (approaching 100 characters)
  - Try adding a task with special characters
  - Try adding a task with the same name in the same category (should show error)
  - Try adding a task with filtered words (should be rejected)

- **Completing Tasks**
  - Mark a task as completed and verify the checkbox works
  - Verify the task gets visual indication of completion (strikethrough)
  - Verify progress bar updates correctly

- **Editing Tasks**
  - Edit an existing task and save changes
  - Try modifying a task to match another task's name (should show error)
  - Check validation works (length, special characters, etc.)

- **Deleting Tasks**
  - Delete individual tasks using the trash icon
  - Use "Clear completed" to remove multiple completed tasks at once

### 2. Categories
- **Default Categories**
  - Verify all default categories are present
  - Verify selecting different categories shows the correct tasks

- **Adding Categories**
  - Create a new category with a unique name
  - Select an emoji from different emoji categories
  - Try creating a category with a reserved name (should be rejected)
  - Try creating a category with the same name (should be rejected)

- **Deleting Categories**
  - Delete a category and verify its tasks are removed
  - Try to delete the last remaining category (should be prevented)

### 3. Filtering & Sorting
- **Filters**
  - Use "All" filter to see all tasks
  - Use "Active" filter to see only incomplete tasks
  - Use "Completed" filter to see only completed tasks

- **Sorting**
  - Test "Newest First" sorting option
  - Test "Oldest First" sorting option
  - Test "Alphabetical" sorting option
  - Test "Incomplete First" sorting option

### 4. Data Persistence
- **LocalStorage**
  - Add several tasks and categories, then refresh the page
  - Verify all data is preserved after refresh
  - Close the browser completely and reopen, verify data is still there
  - Use the "Reset App" button to clear all data
  - Verify default state is restored after reset

### 5. Input Validation
- **Task Validation**
  - Try tasks with fewer than 2 characters (should reject)
  - Try tasks with more than 100 characters (should reject)
  - Try tasks with forbidden characters (should reject)
  - Try tasks with profanity (should reject)

- **Category Validation**
  - Try categories with fewer than 2 characters (should reject)
  - Try categories with more than 20 characters (should reject)
  - Try categories with special characters (should reject)
  - Try categories with reserved names (should reject)

### 6. UI/UX Features
- **Animations**
  - Verify animations when adding a task
  - Verify animations when completing a task
  - Verify animations when deleting a task
  - Verify shake animation when validation errors occur

- **Responsive Design**
  - Test on desktop (wide screen)
  - Test on tablet (medium screen)
  - Test on mobile (narrow screen)
  - Verify all controls remain accessible and usable

## Edge Cases
- Add a very large number of tasks (50+) and test performance
- Add a very large number of categories (20+) and test the category bar
- Use emojis or special unicode characters in task names
- Test with browser developer tools to simulate offline mode

## Known Limitations
- Mobile touch interactions might need refinement
- No multi-user collaboration features
- No recurring tasks functionality
- Task search feature not implemented
